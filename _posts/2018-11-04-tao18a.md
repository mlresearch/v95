title: 'RDEC: Integrating Regularization into Deep Embedded Clustering for Imbalanced
  Datasets'
abstract: Clustering is a fundamental machine learning task and can be used in many
  applications. With the development of deep neural networks (DNNs), combining techniques
  from DNNs with clustering has become a new research direction and achieved some
  success. However, few studies have focused on the imbalanced-data problem which
  commonly occurs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a clustering
  method, regularized deep embedding clustering (RDEC), that integrates virtual adversarial
  training (VAT), a network regularization technique, with a clustering method called
  deep embedding clustering (DEC). DEC optimizes cluster assignments by pushing data
  more densely around centroids in latent space, but it is sometimes sensitive to
  the initial location of centroids, especially in the case of imbalanced data, where
  the minor class has less chance to be assigned a good centroid. RDEC introduces
  regularization using VAT to ensure the model’s robustness to local perturbations
  of data. VAT pushes data that are similar in the original space closer together
  in the latent space, bunching together data from minor classes and thereby facilitating
  cluster identification by RDEC. Combining the advantages of DEC and VAT, RDEC attains
  state-of-the-art performance on both balanced and imbalanced benchmark/real-world
  datasets. For example, accuracies are as high as 98.41% on MNIST dataset and $85.45%$
  on a highly imbalanced dataset derived from the MNIST, which is nearly $8%$ higher
  than the current best result.
