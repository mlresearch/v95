title: A Faster Sampling Algorithm for Spherical $k$-means
abstract: The <em>Spherical $k$-means</em> algorithm proposed by (Dhillon and Modha,
  2001) is a popular algorithm for clustering high dimensional  datasets. Although
  their algorithm is simple and easy to implement, a drawback of the same is that
  it doesnâ€™t provide any provable  guarantee on the   clustering result. (Endo and
  Miyamoto, 2015) suggest an adaptive sampling based algorithm (<em>Spherical
  $k$-means$++$</em>) which gives near optimal results, with high probability. However,
  their algorithm requires $k$ sequential  passes over the entire dataset, which may
  not be feasible when the dataset and/or  the values of $k$ are large. In this work,
  we propose a Markov chain based sampling algorithm that takes only one pass over
  the data, and gives close to optimal clustering similar to  <em>Spherical $k$-means$++$</em>,
  <em>i.e.</em>, a faster algorithm while maintaining almost the same approximation.
  We present a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, and complement it with rigorous
  experiments on   real-world datasets. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy
  to implement, and can be easily adopted in practice.
