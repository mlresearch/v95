title: Clustering Uncertain Graphs with Node Attributes
abstract: 'Graph clustering has attracted much attention in recent years, which has
  wide applications in social and biological networks. Recent approaches on graph
  clustering mainly focus on either certain graphs with node attributes or uncertain
  graphs without node attributes. However, many real-world graphs have both uncertainty
  on the edges and attributes on the nodes. We refer to such networks as \emph{attributed
  uncertain graphs}. Different from conventional graphs, attributed uncertain graphs
  post two major challenges for graph clustering: 1) uncertainty on the edges, which
  makes it difficult to extract reliable clusters; 2) high dimensional attributes
  on the nodes, which contain irrelevant and noisy information. In this paper, we
  study the problem of node clustering on attributed uncertain graphs, where we exploit
  both the uncertain edges and a set of important attributes for graph clustering.
  The uncertain edges can help identify the set of relevant attributes in the nodes,
  which are called focus attributes. While the focus attributes can help reduce the
  uncertainty in edges for graph clustering. We propose two novel approaches: AUG-I
  based upon integrated attribute induced graphs and AUG-U based upon the unified
  partition over possible worlds of a uncertain graph. Extensive empirical studies
  on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches for clustering
  tasks on attributed uncertain graphs.'
