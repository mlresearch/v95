title: Distinguishing Question Subjectivity from Difficulty for Improved Crowdsourcing
abstract: The questions in a crowdsourcing task typically exhibit varying degrees
  of <em>difficulty</em> and <em>subjectivity</em>. Their joint effects give rise
  to the variation in responses to the same question by different crowd-workers. This
  variation is low when the question is easy to answer and objective, and high when
  it is difficult and subjective. Unfortunately, current quality control methods for
  crowdsourcing consider only the question difficulty to account for the variation.
  As a result, these methods cannot distinguish workers' ,<em>personal preferences</em>
  for different correct answers of a <em>partially subjective</em> question from their
  <em>ability</em> to avoid objectively incorrect answers for that question. To address
  this issue, we present a probabilistic model which (i) explicitly encodes question
  difficulty as a model parameter and (ii) implicitly encodes question subjectivity
  via latent <em>preference factors</em> for crowd-workers. We show that question
  subjectivity induces grouping of crowd-workers, revealed through clustering of their
  latent preferences. Moreover, we develop a quantitative measure for the question
  subjectivity. Experiments show that our model (1) improves both the question true
  answer prediction and the unseen worker response prediction, and (2) can potentially
  provide rankings of questions coherent with human assessment in terms of difficulty
  and subjectivity.
