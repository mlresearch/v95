title: A Joint Selective Mechanism for Abstractive Sentence Summarization
abstract: 'Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning framework has been widely used
  in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including abstractive summarization
  and machine translation (MT). However, abstractive summarization generates the output
  in a <em>lossy manner</em>, in comparison with MT which is almost <em>loss-less</em>.
  We model this by introducing a joint selective mechanism: (i) A selective gate is
  added after encoding phase of the Seq2Seq learning framework, which learns to tailor
  the original input information and generates a selected input representation. (ii)
  A selection loss function is also added to help our selective gate function well,
  which is computed by looking at the input and the output jointly. Experimental results
  show that our proposed model outperforms most of the baseline models and is comparable
  to the state-of-the-art model in automatic evaluations.'
