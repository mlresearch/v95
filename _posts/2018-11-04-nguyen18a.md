title: Clustering Induced Kernel Learning
abstract: Learning rich and expressive kernel functions is a challenging task in kernel-based
  supervised learning. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) approach addresses this problem
  by combining a mixed variety of kernels and letting the optimization solver choose
  the most appropriate combination. However, most of existing methods are parametric
  in the sense that they require a predefined list of kernels. Hence, there appears
  a substantial trade-off between computation and the modeling risk of not being able
  to explore more expressive and suitable kernel functions. Moreover, current existing
  approaches to combine kernels cannot exploit clustering structure carried in data,
  especially when data are heterogeneous. In this work, we present a new framework
  that  leverages Bayesian nonparametric models (i.e, automatically grow kernel functions)
  with multiple kernel learning to develop a new framework that enjoys the nonparametric
  flavor in the context of multiple kernel learning. In particular, we propose <em>Clustering
  Induced Kernel Learning</em> (CIK) method that can automatically discover clustering
  structure from the data and train a single kernel machine to fit data in each discovered
  cluster simultaneously. The outcome of our proposed method includes both clustering
  analysis and multiple kernel classifier for a given dataset. We conduct extensive
  experiments on several benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that our
  method can improve classification and clustering performance when datasets have
  complex clustering structure with different preferred kernels.
